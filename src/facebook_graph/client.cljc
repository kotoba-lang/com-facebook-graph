(ns facebook-graph.client
  "Portable core for talking to the Meta Marketing API (Graph API, Marketing
  surface) -- one auth/HTTP boundary for every facebook-graph.* namespace in
  this library. Covers Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Audience Network
  placements, which share one Marketing API domain (graph.facebook.com).

  This is the `kotoba-lang/com-facebook-graph` provider repo named in
  cloud-itonami's ADR-0023 (media-network domain adapters). A prior
  implementation of this provider existed only as an uncommitted Python
  virtualenv under this same path (recovered evidence: compiled .pyc/
  .pytest_cache files with no .py source, no git history, no GitHub repo --
  see the `advertising-strategy-itonami.md` sales/ads index for the
  investigation). This rewrite follows the actual kotoba-lang convention
  used by sibling vendor-API clients (`com-cloudflare`): portable `.cljc`,
  pure query/response handling, real HTTP behind an injectable `:http-fn` so
  every namespace is testable with a stub, never only against a live
  account.

  Query construction and response parsing are pure .cljc. The actual HTTP
  call is JVM-only by default (java.net.http) but always takes an
  injectable `:http-fn` -- the same `{:url :method :headers :body} ->
  {:status :body}` convention as cloudflare.client/jvm-http-fn."
